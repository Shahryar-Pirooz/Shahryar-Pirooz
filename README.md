# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I’m Shahryar – a full-stack software engineer with a passion for backend systems, privacy-focused development, and clean architecture.  

🔧 I mostly work with Go, PostgreSQL, Docker, and microservices on the backend, and use React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS for frontend tasks when needed.  

🛡️ I care about secure coding, DevOps practices, and building systems that are reliable, scalable, and self-hostable.  

🐧 I’ve been a Linux user and FOSS advocate for over a decade.  

📂 You can find my open-source work here on GitHub — including full-stack tools, crawlers, bots, and dev utilities.
